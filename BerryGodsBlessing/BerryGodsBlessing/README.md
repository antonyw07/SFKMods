# Berry God's Blessing

A lightweight BepInEx mod for **Super Fantasy Kingdom** that adds a feature granting blessings from the Berry God. The more berries bushes in your kingdom, the more likely you will be blessed by the Berry God. The Berry God's blessings have various effects that can benefit the kingdom.

## 📦 Features

- Every day you have a chance to be blessed by the Berry God, scaling by the count of berry bushes growing in your kingdom.
- If you are granted a blessing the Hermit will notify you of the specific blessing bestowed upon you.
- Only a handful of blessings exist currently, but more will be implemented later.
- I also plan to allow for user creation of blessings in future releases.
